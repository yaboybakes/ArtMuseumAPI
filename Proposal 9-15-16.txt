The U-Seum
Since the onset of the Internet, students and scholars of art have relied on site-by-site pathways to research materials from a variety of online resources: web encyclopedias such as Wikipedia and online databases offered by different museums, each largely self-contained and thus absent of external materials.
Our proposal seeks to coordinate access to the Internet’s major art museum databases, to consolidate them into a single view for visitors to pull resources from multiple sites. The goal of this project is to improve researchers’ ability to access visual and textual data simultaneously from databases hosted by different museums, to provide a synoptic (and perhaps encyclopedic) review of works representing a distinct tradition, artist, topic, or region. Our application will also provide account options, with which users may save selections for consultation in future sessions.
Upon website landing visitors will be invited to a set of ten randomly presented thumbnail images: should the visitor have a general curiosity, they may select any of these images to learn more about its provenience, author, description, and context. However, the front page will also provide input fields for visitors to refine their searches when they have more specific queries.
The application will use APIs to access data from the Rijksmuseum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Harvard Art Museums, and other databases that will return requests in JSON format. We will select data object values and present them in concise, discrete elements that will individually describe, preview, and supplement materials related to the artistic work at hand.
One of our current priorities is developing a display that will effectively manage the multiple fields of information that each entry will provide. We look to implement our display upon a single-page website. We will also use Firebase to save user account information and whatever search requests and “favorited” items they select.
